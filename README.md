# NoiseReconstruction
Image noise reconstruction: Approximately reconstructing original image noise according to a Poisson-Gaussian signal-dependent noise model using PCA. Derived from a noise parameter estimation method presented by Stanyslav Pyatykh. Implemented in Python. This program was part of my bachelor's thesis.
