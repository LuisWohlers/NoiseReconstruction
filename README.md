# NoiseReconstruction
Image noise reconstruction: Approximately reconstructing original image noise in a filtered image according to a Poisson-Gaussian signal-dependent noise model using PCA. Derived from a noise parameter estimation method presented by Stanyslav Pyatykh (http://physics.medma.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/projects/132-pcanle). Implemented in Python. This program was part of my bachelor's thesis and contains only the code added to the written work in currently uncommented fashion.
