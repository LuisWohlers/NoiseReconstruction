# NoiseReconstruction
Image noise reconstruction: Approximately reconstructing original image noise in a filtered image according to a Poisson-Gaussian signal-dependent noise model using PCA. Derived from a noise parameter estimation method presented by Stanyslav Pyatykh (http://physics.medma.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/projects/132-pcanle) and implemented in EstimateNoiseParameters.py. Implemented in Python.
